# Space Shooter - Unity Game
### Overview
Space Shooter is a 2D game developed as a project for the `AI for Games` program, part of the `MSc AI ML` curriculum. In this game, players control a spaceship navigating through space, facing off against AI-controlled enemy spaceships. The enemy ships utilize Finite State Machines (FSMs) and Perception mechanisms to chase, follow, and shoot at the player's spaceship, providing an engaging and challenging gameplay experience.

### Features
Intuitive spaceship controls for immersive gameplay.
AI-controlled enemy spaceships with advanced behaviors:
Chase: Pursue the player's spaceship.
Follow: Maintain a certain distance from the player while chasing.
Shoot: Fire projectiles at the player's spaceship.


### Gameplay
Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the player's spaceship.
Navigate through space to avoid enemy fire and engage enemy spaceships.
Destroy enemy spaceships by shooting them down with your spaceship's weapons.
Beware of enemy spaceships' advanced AI behaviors, including chasing, following, and shooting.

### AI Mechanisms
The AI-controlled enemy spaceships employ the following mechanisms:

Finite State Machines (FSMs): Used to model the behavior of enemy spaceships, allowing them to transition between states such as chasing, following, and shooting based on predefined conditions and actions.
Perception: Enemy spaceships perceive the player's spaceship and its movements through sensors, enabling them to react and adapt their behaviors accordingly.
